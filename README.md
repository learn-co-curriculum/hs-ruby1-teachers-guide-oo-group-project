## Unit 6: Introduction to Ruby

### SWBATs
+ Work collaboratively to develop an object-oriented set of models that simulate real world environments.

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ The object-oriented group challenge involves building out a set of models that imitate the real world and interact with each other. Knowing object orientation like the back of your hand is essential to being a strong Ruby programmer. Whether you're building a simple command line application or a full-fledged web application, object orientation will help you build in an efficient, D.R.Y., and reusable manner.

### Lesson Plan
+ Start lesson by selecting an environment to model. Some models we've had success teaching are:
  + A baby
  + [A jungle](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/hs-oo-jungle-project-demo)
  + Instagram
  + Facebook
  + A car and its owner
+ Whiteboard with class all the attributes and actions of the model.
+ Review these concepts during demo:
  + Readers and writers, then `attr_accessor`
  + `self`
  + Methods that create new instances of a class
  + Instances of a class interacting with each other
  + Class methods
  + Constants
+ Build out, with students' help, a basic set of models that can be interacted with in the command line, via a runner file that requires all necessary files.
+ Students then dive into the group challenges, starting with the [OO Cash Register](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/hs-oo-cash-register). They can move on to the [Jukebox](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/oo-jukebox) if they finish. 

### Conclusion / So What?
+ Object orientation is not unique to Ruby. It's a programming concept that many different languages implement. So once you've gotten it down in Ruby, it'll be easy to translate your knowledge onto other programming languages that you'll learn, like JavaScript. So many of these concepts cut across languages, so the more you know, the easier it'll be to master additional languages in the future.

### Hints and Hurdles
+ You can start off the class with a game of [Ruby Jeopardy](https://docs.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/presentation/d/15lxFavK4t-Gmv7dOANBPHiLflKpPgSejAGEnDuqN9Pc/edit?usp=sharing). Don't forget your Alex Trebek costume! And do use the Jeopardy theme song, which you can grab from YouTube.
